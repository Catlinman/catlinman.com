# Hey there! I'm Catlinman! #

I prefer being called Cat in short but whatever you prefer works! I do pretty much anything and everything that has to do with computers ranging from digital art, animation and modelling over to programming, game design, web development and engineering all the way to making electronic music.

_As of 2020 this handle has been retired. This page serves as a showcase of the work I did and my online persona at the time. It's time to move on though. Thanks for having come along for this part of my journey!_

If you wish to continue following my journey and seeing where I am now, head on over to [zealsprince.com](https://zealsprince.com)

## Website ##

Right now this is being [hosted from a Markdown file](https://github.com/catlinman/catlinman.com/). I'm in the process of recreating the old design of my website while condensing it down to a clean portfolio of my work.

_You'll see it when it's done™️_
